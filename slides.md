We will configure a DNS entry

<!-- sequenceDiagram
    Client->>DNS: https://unibe.ch
    DNS--))Client: 130.92.250.6

    Client->>Webserver (130.92.250.6): Let me see the Homepage of unibe.ch (GET-request)
    Webserver (130.92.250.6)--))Client: There you go! (Response with HTML body) -->

---

## What is HTML

- It's a **Markup language** (like XML)
- There is content inside a hierarchical structure made up of tags

`<p class="red-paragraph">This is the content</p>`

---

## What is CSS

- Cascading **Style Sheets**
- describes how the elements in the HTML-Markup should be displayed

```css
.red-paragraph {
  color: red;
  border: 1px solid;
}
```

<style>
.red-paragraph {
   color: red;
   border: 1px solid;
}

</style>
<p class="red-paragraph">This is the content</p>

---

## What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a simple and easy to use markup language than can be compiled (translated) to html.

`It's what **all of us** should write _all_ the time!`
-->
It's what **all of us** should write _all_ the time!

## What is _git_ and _GitHub_, and why should I care?

- git is the foundation of software development.
- it keeps track of everthing that was.
- it enables people to work at the same file at the same time and then take care of the merging later

---

- Github is a service owned by Microsoft.
- It provides many additional services on top of typical git-functions (like git remote servers). We will be using:
  - Github Template Repositories
  - Github Actions
  - Github Codespaces

---

## What is Jekyll?

- Static site generator
- digests Markdown (and many other file formats) and creates a functioning website out of it
- based on ruby
- easy set up with themes

---

## What are GithubPages (Hosting our page the easy way)

- Free Hosting-Service of Github

---

Time for a break?

---

## Choosing a template

**https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio**

(There are many more)

- https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme
- https://pages.github.com/themes/
- https://academicpages.github.io/

---

## Deploying with GitHub Pages

1. create new repo from [template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)

<details><summary>2. change the action-permission</summary>
<p>Click on Actions tab and Enable GitHub Actions</p>
<p>Go to Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions, and give Read and write permissions to GitHub Actions.</p>
</details>
<details><summary>3. change the config</summary>
<p>In _config.yml, set url to https://&#060;your-github-username>.github.io and baseurl to /&#060;your-repository-name>/.</p></details>
<details><summary>4. config the ghpages-options</summary>
<p>In the Settings of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to master).</p>
</details>

---

### Setting up the domain

1. [buying a domain](http://www.domains.ch)
2. creating a CNAME DNS Record (username.github.io) or [A Name](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)

<!--### Setting up a local environment

- clone your git repo onto your computer
- docker-compose up
-->

## Create Content

[features of al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#features)

---

### adding static pages

just create a new page in the _\_pages_-folder and add the frontmatter:

```YAML
layout: page
permalink: /static/
title: static page
description: Materials and stuff
nav: true
nav_order: 5
```

---

### adding publications

- upload your bib file into `_bibliography/papers.bib`
- edit the _publications_-Page

```
{% bibliography %}
```

- if you want the bib-button for every entry: edit `\_layouts\bib.html`
  --> look for _Bib_ and delete the if-statement.

---

#### Special fields

you can add lots of special properties to your items in the bib file:
https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#publications

- to add them easily in zotero: install [betterbibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)
- add the fields in the extra-field:
  `tex.field: value`

[source](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/extra-fields/)
---
#### Publication preview-images

(pictures to the left of the titles)

- Reference them in your Bib by filename.
- Upload the images into `assets/img/publication_preview/`

or just reference a URL of the image.

- the filename has to obey the following syntax: _YEAR-MONTH-DAY-TITLE-WITH-SPACES_

Minimal frontmatter: title, layout

more info: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

---

### Collections

are there to divide subpages into categories - similar to posts.

---

That's it for now! Happy coding!
